# Resynth-Mod
A mod for Minecraft that adds growable ores, mob drops (yet to be implemented) and other ore drops, such as diamond and coal.

## Work In Progress
This mod is still in its first stages of development, so some features are missing and
most numbers still need to be balanced. A website is also in the works.
